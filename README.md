**Quorum** is an flexible framework for ETL and analysis specific to open source
information research and intelligence - a WordPress for open source intelligence. 
It provides core logic and infrastructure for third-party data collection and processing, 
and leaves the specifics of data acquisition, augmentation, and analysis to third-party
plugins. 

## Components
* Consumers: Data ingestion (i.e., scrapers).

* Processors: Item processing (e.g., entity extraction, mention extraction).

* Analyzers: Batch jobs (e.g., community detection, aggregations like pattern-of-life).

# Getting Started
The idea here is that **Quorum** should be the place for everybody to come
together!
Do you have an acquisition/processing/analysis task that you want to get done?
Feel free to open up an issue and (for whatever group you are in) and we'll 
work on incoporating it to Quorum.
